## Description
Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

### Specs
* Allow the user to start the order process.  The base price for a small plain pizza is $10
* Allow the user to add-on to the base pizza.  The pizza size will be added first and pizza toppings will be entered into an array.
* When the user is finished the pizza attributes (size, toppings, price) are displayed


### Known Bugs

1. selecting a pizza with > 1 topping causes multiple instances of that pizza to be generated before determining the final pie price.  While this can be worked around, it does cause a pizza ordered with multiple toppings and no size selected to throw the "Choose a size" alert an amount equal to the amount of toppings selected.
1. no gluten free option.  Celiacs should not order from Pamparius Pizza
